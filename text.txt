Cricket is a game played with bat and ball having 11 players on each side of the two teams.

 The person who hits the ball is called “Batsman”, another person who bowls is called “Bowler”.

 The aim of the two teams is to restrict the opponent to fewer runs while bowling and make maximum runs while batting.

 Before the start of the game a coin is tossed, with heads as winners and tails as losers of the toss, the winner of the toss decides either to bowl or bat first.

 To give a batsman out there are two judges who stand on the field, they are called “Umpires”.

 There is a third umpire who sits outside the field to assist the field umpires while giving “Run- Out”, “Leg Before Wicket” etc.

Match referee is also a part of this game who observes the moral conduct of the players in a match, and also punishes them for violation of rules.

 The apex body which governs cricket in the whole world is the ICC (International Cricket Council).

 Cricket matches are played in a ground having a rectangular clearing in the middle known as a pitch; its length is 20.12m or 22 yards in length and 10ft (3.05 meters) in width.

Three wickets on each end are placed on the pitch, and the batsman while batting has the responsibility to protect the wickets from falling.
